# Booking Receipts

- Receipts are generated for every successful booking
- Receipts can be viewed by the admin and user through the dashboard
- Receipts can be re-generated (by the manager) or voided (by the manager)
- Each booking type has itâ€™s own receipt table
- Different from cashier receipts (cashier receipts are more like payment receipts, but a car rental receipt is more specific to the booking)
