# App Structure

To build a flight booking app using the Quasar Framework, we can structure the project in a way that supports scalability, maintainability, and ease of development. Below is a suggested directory structure for the project and a breakdown of what each folder and file contains.

Quasar Framework Flight Booking App Project Structure:

```
/flight-booking-app

│   ├── /assets
│   ├── /boot
│   ├── /components
│   ├── /composables
│   ├── /css

├── /package.json
└── /README.md
```

1. /src Directory
Purpose: Contains the core application files, including UI components, layout files, and Vuex stores.
/assets

Purpose: Static assets like images, icons, and fonts.
Example:
```
/assets
├── logo.png
└── airplane-icon.svg
/boot
```

Purpose: Boot files that initialize things before the app starts (e.g., Axios setup, authentication, third-party libraries).
Example:

```
/boot
├── axios.js  # Setup for API requests
├── i18n.js   # Internationalization setup
└── auth.js   # Auth/Session handling
/components
```

Purpose: Reusable UI components such as buttons, input fields, modals, or flight card components.
Example:

```
/components
├── FlightSearchForm.vue
├── FlightCard.vue
├── PassengerForm.vue
└── BookingSummary.vue
/composables
```

Purpose: Reusable Vue 3 composition functions for logic handling.
Example:

```
/composables
├── useFlightSearch.js
└── usePayment.js
/css
```

Purpose: Custom styles or SASS files.
Example:

```
/css
├── app.scss  # Global styles
└── flight-booking.scss  # Specific flight booking styles
/layouts
```

Purpose: Application-wide layout files like headers, footers, and navigation bars.
Example:

```
/layouts
├── MainLayout.vue  # Main layout with nav bar and footer
└── AuthLayout.vue  # Login, registration layout
/pages
```

Purpose: Individual page components for routes like flight search, booking, and checkout.
Example:

```
/pages
├── HomePage.vue  # Main flight search page
├── FlightDetailsPage.vue  # Flight details with options to select seats
├── BookingPage.vue  # Checkout, payments, and review details
├── ProfilePage.vue  # User profile page
└── BookingConfirmationPage.vue  # Booking confirmation
/router
```

Purpose: Vue Router setup for defining app routes and navigation guards (auth protection).
Example:

```
/router
└── index.js  # Route definitions for different pages
/store
```

Purpose: Vuex store for managing application state, such as user info, flights, bookings, and payments.
Example:

```
/store
├── index.js   # Vuex store entry
├── modules
│   ├── flights.js  # Manages flight data and search results
│   ├── user.js     # Manages user authentication and profile
│   └── bookings.js # Manages booking state
/i18n
```

Purpose: Internationalization (i18n) files to support multiple languages.
Example:

```
/i18n
├── en-US.js  # English translations
└── fr-FR.js  # French translations
/services
```

Purpose: Service layer that handles API calls for fetching flight data, bookings, etc.
Example:

```
/services
├── flightService.js  # API calls to search and fetch flights
├── bookingService.js  # API calls to handle flight booking
├── userService.js     # API calls for user authentication
└── paymentService.js  # API calls for payments
/utils
```

Purpose: Utility functions for date manipulation, formatting, validation, etc.
Example:

```
/utils
├── dateUtils.js  # Date formatting and parsing
├── currencyUtils.js  # Currency conversion/formatting
└── validation.js  # Validation rules for forms
/models
```

Purpose: Model definitions representing flight data, user profiles, and booking details.
Example:

```
/models
├── Flight.js  # Flight data structure
├── User.js  # User model
└── Booking.js  # Booking details structure
/mixins
```

Purpose: Mixins for reusable logic or functions across components.
Example:

```
/mixins
└── formValidationMixin.js  # Mixin for form validation
```

2. /public Directory
Purpose: Static files that won’t be processed by Webpack. Used for public assets like the favicon, images, etc.
Example:

```
/public
├── favicon.ico
└── index.html
```

3. /node_modules
Purpose: Dependencies and libraries installed via npm or yarn.

4. quasar.conf.js
Purpose: Main configuration file for the Quasar app. It contains important settings like plugins, build configurations, and router mode (SPA, SSR, PWA).

5. package.json
Purpose: Specifies the project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and other configurations for npm.

6. README.md
Purpose: Documentation that provides an overview of the project, how to install, and usage instructions.
Key Components Breakdown:
Flight Search Form (FlightSearchForm.vue): Handles input for flight searches (origin, destination, dates, passengers).
Flight Card (FlightCard.vue): Displays flight details and provides selection options.
Booking Summary (BookingSummary.vue): Displays selected flight details, pricing, and booking confirmation.
Quasar-Specific Features to Utilize:
Quasar UI Components: Use Quasar’s built-in UI components like forms, buttons, dialogs, date pickers, etc., to build the interface quickly.
Quasar CLI: Use the Quasar CLI to scaffold the project and manage configurations for building SPA, PWA, or mobile apps.
SSR or PWA: If performance is critical, consider enabling server-side rendering (SSR) or progressive web app (PWA) support.
This structure ensures your flight booking app is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain over time. You can add further layers (like analytics, notifications, etc.) as the app grows.
